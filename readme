# Mini Wallet Service

Overview

Mini Wallet Service is a backend application built using **Node.js, Express, and MySQL**.  
It simulates a real-world wallet system that supports:

- User creation
- Wallet creation (one wallet per user)
- Credit money
- Debit money
- View wallet balance and last 10 transactions

The system is designed with a strong focus on:

- I. Data consistency  
- II. Concurrency handling  
- III. Idempotency  
- IV. Atomic transactions

 Architecture

Client → Express API → MySQL Database

The application uses:

- MySQL connection pooling
- Database-level constraints
- SQL transactions for atomic operations
- Row-level locking for concurrency control

# 🗄 Database Design

The system contains three tables:

## 1 users
Stores user information.

- user_id (UNIQUE)
- user_name
- user_email (UNIQUE)
- user_phone (UNIQUE)
- created_at

## 2 wallets
Stores wallet balance.

- user_id (UNIQUE)
- balance (DECIMAL)
- created_at
- updated_at

One user → One wallet (enforced using UNIQUE constraint).

## 3 transactions
Stores all credit/debit operations (including failed ones).

- transaction_id (UNIQUE)
- user_id
- type (CREDIT / DEBIT)
- amount
- status (SUCCESS / FAILED)
- reference_id (UNIQUE for idempotency)
- failure_reason
- created_at
